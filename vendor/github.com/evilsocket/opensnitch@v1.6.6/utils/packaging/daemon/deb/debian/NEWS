opensnitch (1.6.0-rc.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    From now on the eBPF modules will be installed under
    /usr/lib/opensnitchd/ebpf/.

    The daemon will look for the eBPF modules in these directories and order:
    - /usr/local/lib/opensnitchd/ebpf/
    - /usr/lib/opensnitchd/ebpf/

    Modules under /etc/opensnitchd/ will still be loaded if found, but it's
    deprecated and will be removed in the future.

    There's a new module to intercept processes execution. It may cause some
    rules not to match: for example if you allowed /bin/telnet, now it may be
    reported as /usr/bin/inteutils-telnet
    
    These cases are mostly expected. We'll keep improving it, sorry for
    the inconveniences.
